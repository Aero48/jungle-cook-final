# Jungle Cook Final

## Task

For this final, your team will be taking this prototype, https://xd.adobe.com/spec/000d9233-c620-4eb6-5884-adaea1a04abb-763c/Links to an external site., and making it fully functional. This site must be fully responsive for desktops and tablets, 1024×768, and must be a fully working CRUD application.

## Who Worked on What:

### Emma

- Styling: Home, Recipe Edit, Recipe Change, Recipe View, Page Resposiveness
- Function: Login/ Sign-up Page , Your Recipes Toggle, Make + button work and put objects in array

Emma Ash: This team project was a great experience for me. I feel like I was able to help in my strong areas and also learn a lot from Logan while working on some of the sections I have more trouble with. Logan and I initially split the pages of the website in half to get them styled nicely. This helped us get a good base to start adding functionality. I first worked on the functionality of the Login/ Sign Up page by implementing a function that allows the user to log in and store their information in an array within the browser. Logan took charge of making the top navigation toggle back and forth when you are logged in and logged out, and I followed that by making sure the footer matched as well. I also used what we learned in class to make the “+” button on all the recipe pages function correctly on the surface. I also worked to create the hamburger menu that appears when the page reaches a certain screen width and initially used CSS and Html to make it toggle back and forth. Overall Logan took charge of more of the functionality portion of the website while I focused on the responsiveness and styling. In order to make the website function at multiple different screen widths I implemented many media queries that targeted a screen below 800px and a screen below 400px. I made changes in each of these sections when needed to make the screen resize seamlessly.

### Logan

- Styling: Nav, Footer, Login, Browse, Your Recipes
- Function: MVC Model, Recipe Injection, Make New Recipe

Logan Douglass: My primary focus was the functionality side of the site. On the initial creation of the project, I did style the navbar, footer, login page, browse recipes, and user recipes but most of my work for the rest of the project was on the JavaScript code. For the main structure of the project, I built the initial MVC system for dynamically loading the page content. On the recipe list, recipe view, and your recipes page, I programmed the HTML injection for elements of the recipe array. I also helped Emma program the functionality of the create and edit recipe forms (mainly the system that allows you to add ingredient fields and instruction fields) and made both functions only accessible to users who are logged in. On the backend, I wrote the add, update, and delete recipe functions essential to the CRUD application. After all the essential features were implemented, I provided help to Emma’s side of the project with bug fixing on the login, signup, and hamburger menu.
